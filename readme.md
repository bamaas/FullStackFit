### What is this application about?
In my free time I like to be in the gym and move some weights. For years I keep track of my body weight in an Excel sheet. At the end of a week I calculate the average of that week and compare it with the previous week, so I can determine if I lost or gained weight. I thought it would be nice to build a web application to replace the Excel sheet.
